* HPML Assignment 2: ResNet18 and CIFAR10
** Instructions for execution of code

Code in ~lab2.py~ takes arguments to customize optimizers, workers, and other helpful arguments for the model and execution. In order to run the code for each exercise, use the following (with the appropriate ~C1~ through ~C7~) command *from the root directory*:

#+begin_src bash
sbatch sbatch/C1.sh
#+end_src

Also note, C5 has two files ~C5_1.sh~ and ~C5_2.sh~ for the GPU and CPU-only nodes.

For running all of the code from ~C1~ to ~C7~, use the following:

#+begin_src bash
bash sbatch/run_all.sh
#+end_src
** Structure of Repository
#+begin_src artist
